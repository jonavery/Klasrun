# Klasrun
Every script in the Klasrun library serves the purpose of saving time and improving accuracy. The scripts accomplish this through automating tasks that would otherwise be menial, arduous, and time-consuming. There are essentially two halves to the Klasrun automation library - Google Sheets and Amazon Marketplace Web Service (MWS). Google Sheets serves as our online inventory dataplace, while we use MWS to take that inventory and sell it to customers across North America. The code in the Klasrun library makes it possible for these two halves to directly communicate with each other.
